# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions for problems posted on Project Euler (www.projecteuler.net). I have made this repository public for **resume purposes only** and will soon make it private again. My solutions are written in Python, but I would like to rewrite some of them in a compiled language (C++/Java) to test speed improvements.

## What is Project Euler?
From their website:

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
